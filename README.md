# Pre-course preparation

The Computational Psychiatry Course (CPC) Zurich is split into several parts. Starting with an introduction to Psychiatry (Day 1), the CPC then offers three days that will cover computational methods in detail and a final day on concrete applications. Some background knowledge in statistics and computational methods is needed to master the more technical parts (Days 2-4). If you lack this background, it is recommended that you prepare for this course. In this repository, we list some recommended reading and useful resources for you to best prepare. Enjoy!

*Note:* All recommended [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) are freely available. As for the recommended reading, try using tools and platforms such as [Kopernio](https://kopernio.com/) or [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/) to find freely accessible versions of papers, in case you hit a paywall.
